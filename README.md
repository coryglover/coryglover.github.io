I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in Network Science at Northeastern University, advised by Dr. Albert-László Barabási. I study complex systems with a focus on how local interactions give rise to large-scale patterns in data. I'm passionate about interdisciplinary research and am currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities to continue exploring complex systems through new lenses.

My research spans network science, time series analysis, and spectral graph theory. In my dissertation, I have developed fast new metrics for quantifying entanglement in physical networks, introduced generative models to capture the rules of network assembly, and evaluated methods for reconstructing networks from node-level time-series dynamics. My work on physical entanglement was featured in Physical Review Letters' Best of 2024 edition and highlighted as an Editors’ Suggestion.

I earned an MS in Network Science from Northeastern University in 2024, and an MS and BS in Mathematics from Brigham Young University in 2021 and 2019, respectively.
