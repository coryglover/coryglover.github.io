I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in Network Science at Northeastern University, advised by Dr. Albert-László Barabási. I study complex systems and how they shape the world around us—focusing especially on how local interactions give rise to large-scale patterns across diverse types of data.

My research spans physical networks, time series analysis, and spectral graph theory. In my dissertation, I develop fast new metrics for quantifying entanglement in physical networks, introduce generative models to capture the rules of network assembly, and evaluate methods for reconstructing networks from node-level time-series dynamics. My work on physical entanglement was featured in Physical Review Letters' Best of 2024 edition and highlighted as an Editors’ Suggestion.

I'm passionate about interdisciplinary research and collaboration, and I’m currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities where I can continue to explore complex systems through new lenses.
