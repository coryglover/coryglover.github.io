    <p> I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in Network Science at Northeastern University, advised by Dr. Albert-László Barabási. I study how local interactions in complex systems give rise to large-scale patterns in data, and I’m currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities to continue this work through new interdisciplinary collaborations. </p> 
    <p> I like to say I’m a mathematician with too many interests. I’ve worked on projects in materials science, neurostimulation, and psychology, often serving as the “math guy” on interdisciplinary teams. I’m especially drawn to complex systems—networks of interacting parts—and enjoy modeling their structure and dynamics across domains, from ecological systems and animal behavior to collaboration networks and information flow. </p> 
    <p>
    At Northeastern, my PhD research has centered on physical networks and network reconstruction using tools from statistical physics, Bayesian inference, and graph theory. 
    Before this, I earned my BS and MS in Mathematics at Brigham Young University, where I focused on spectral graph theory and developed new methods for community detection using non-backtracking random walks and PageRank variations. </p> 
    <p>
    In addition to research, I’m passionate about teaching mathematics in a way that bridges theory and real-world application. I believe clear, example-driven instruction fosters the kind of intuition needed to tackle complex problems—for students and instructors alike. 
    </p>
    <p> Outside of work, I enjoy writing music, traveling, exploring the Atlanta aquarium with my wife, reading with a cat on my lap, and catching live theater whenever I can. </p>
